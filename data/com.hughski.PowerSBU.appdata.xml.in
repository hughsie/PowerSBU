  <summary>Visualize solar, battery and utility power data</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Do you want to make your utility bill smaller, lower your carbon
      footprint, or just write a book in an off-grid cabin in the woods?
      You'll need some software to monitor how much power is being generated,
      how much is stored, and how much is being used so you can plan accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you've taken the decision to install solar panels you enter a maze of
      technologies all managed by arcane, bizarre, and usually proprietary
      software.
    </p>
    <p>
      PowerSBU allows you to visualize the usage of solar, battery and utility
      power over different time spans, allowing you to effectively manage
      battery banks and solar panel arrays.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a pluggable design, PowerSBU can support different types of hardware.
      Currently supported devices include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>PowerSBU OpenHardware</li>
      <li>PIP-MS/MSX</li>
    </ul>
